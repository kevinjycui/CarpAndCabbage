## Inspiration
For centuries, cabbage and fish have been at war.
We are inspired to create games that tackle unique mechanics. A mechanic we want to see more in gaming is the ability to alter the state of an opponent's environment. Inspired by the rise of multiplayer minigames in recent years, we aimed to incorporate this mechanic into the gameplay of a 1v1 online multiplayer platform game.

## What it does
Carp and Cabbage is an online 1v1 platformer, where you try to survive by breaking platforms and releasing bouncy hot peppers onto the opponent's side while dodging their sabotages on yourself. Play as the graceful carp or the flamboyant cabbage, outmaneuvering and outlasting the other player.

## How we built it
Our game is built using Ubisoft's Hacker NEST API UbiGame game engine and written in C++. The backend server runs with socket.io on node.js. We host the server on Heroku, allowing any two players with the game to play against each other.  We take advantage of UbiGame's various components to add physics, animation, and effects to our game.

## Challenges we ran into
Challenges arose throughout development, including issues synchronizing the game over the multiplayer server, implementing the physics of each item in the game, and understanding the UbiGame documentation.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to create a finished and polished multiplayer game. 

## What we learned
We learned much about the process of game development, from planning to building the components to fitting them all together. We also learned how rewarding it is to play a game developed by ourselves, and had fun playing with it as we improved it.

## What's next for Carp and Cabbage
We believe that we can expand the possibilities of this mechanic. Adding various other methods of sabotaging and dodging, as well as implementing a racing mode that allows players to race upwards as the level scrolls are mechanics that would add even more value to this game.
